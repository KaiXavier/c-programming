> ## What is C programming? 😅😅

**C** is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming,
lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system.

By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions.
It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language.
Such applications include operating systems and various application software
for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.

> ## How to create a c file ?

All the files related to C ends with .c ( .c is the extension to specify that it's a C program ).

eg :- `main.c`, `basics.c`

> ## what is a header file?

In C language, header files contain the set of predefined standard library functions.
Your request to use a header file in your program by including it with the C preprocessing directive “#include”.

All the header file have a "`.h`" an extension. By including a header file, we can use its contents in our program.

## 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫 ❓❓

<br>

### In simple language ,

header file is a collection of predefined functions.

( predefined functions are those functions that are already defined and available to use in the program )

## 😮😮😮

in different language its know by different name like library, module etc. (so don't be confused)

> ## what are variables ?

variable are containors that store values in it.

    syntax:-
        <datatype> variable_name ;

    eg:-
        int a;      its stores a integer value.
        float a;    its stores a float value.
        char a; its stores a character as value.

> ## what are datatype?

In computer science and computer programming,
a data type or simply type is an attribute of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.

Most programming languages support basic data types of integer numbers (of varying sizes),
floating-point numbers (which approximate real numbers), characters and Booleans.

A data type constrains the values that an expression, such as a variable or a function, might take.

This data type defines the operations that can be done on the data, the meaning of the data, and the way values of that type can be stored.

A data type provides a set of values from which an expression (i.e. variable, function, etc.) may take its values.

> **TRANSLATION:-**

datatype are the classification of data in to different types,

## 😮😮😮

we have a wide range of datatype

like:-

-   int
-   float
-   double
-   boolean
-   char
