/*
In programming first thing that you need to do, when you learn a new programming language is to print Hello World
*/

{
    printf("Hello world");
}

/*

you won't be understanding anything, what this is and its perfectly okay

just run the code.

if you are using Mingw type:-
    "gcc helloWorld.c"
    "a.exe"     (In most case, the name to the .exe file created is "a" if you are getting anything else type that in )

OUTPUT:-
    Hello world
